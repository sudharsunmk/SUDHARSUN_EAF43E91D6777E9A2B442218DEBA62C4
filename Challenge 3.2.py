'''Implement a function called sort_students that takes a list of student objects as input and sorts the list based on their CGPA (Cumulative Grade Point Average) in descending order. Each student object has the following attributes: name (string), roll_number (string), and cgpa (float). Test the function with different input lists of students.'''
